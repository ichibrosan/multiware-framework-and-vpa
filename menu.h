//  * The gpCgi object is created dynamically and is expected to manage:
//  * - Retrieving form data submitted through HTTP methods (GET, POST).
//  * - Accessing environment variables related to the CGI execution context.
//  * - Providing utilities for structured and secure interaction with the CGI interface.
//  *
//  * @note It is important to properly initialize gpCgi before use with
//  *       `new Cgicc()`, and ensure its lifecycle (e.g., destruction when no
//  *       longer needed) is properly handled to prevent memory leaks.

//  *
//  * This variable is utilized across multiple modules to enable seamless

//  * - Enumeration of files in a directory.
//  * - Conversion between file paths, names, and extensions.
//  * - Generation of fully qualified file paths and URLs for various resources

//  *
//  * Typically, this variable is initialized with a specific CSV file name
//  * corresponding to the respective application's schema setup details.
//  *
//  * Usage context:
//  * - It is utilized in multiple application components such as `journal`, `menu`,
//  *   and `logout` to manage schema data across different functionalities.
//  *
//  * Initialization and usage:
//  * - `gpSchema` is instantiated as a new `schema` object with a file
//  *   name specific to the context, such as "journal.csv" or "user-menu.csv."
//  * - The `gen_from_schema` method is often invoked on this object to generate schema
//  *   data using an input handle and optional parameters.
//  *
//  * Memory management:
//  * - The lifetime of this pointer matches the application's lifecycle, and proper
//  *   memory management and deallocation must be ensured to avoid memory leaks.
