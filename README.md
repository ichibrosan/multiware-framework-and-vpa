A comprehensive C++ framework providing Virtual Protocol Adapter (VPA) RPC services and multiware system capabilities for distributed computing environments.

## üìã Detailed Description

The Virtual Protocol Adapter & Multiware Framework (mwfw2) is a sophisticated, enterprise-grade C++ framework designed for distributed computing environments. It provides a robust foundation for building secure, scalable applications with advanced RPC capabilities, comprehensive user management, and professional console-based interfaces.

### Core Architecture

The framework is built around two primary components that work seamlessly together:

#### 1. Virtual Protocol Adapter (VPA)
The VPA component provides a complete RPC infrastructure with the following capabilities:

**Authentication & Security:**
- **Pre-Shared Key (PSK) Authentication**: Secure initial authentication using configurable pre-shared keys
- **Token-Based Session Management**: Dynamic authentication tokens for ongoing session security
- **Multi-Level Authorization**: Role-based access control with configurable authorization levels
- **Session Handle Management**: Unique session identifiers for tracking and managing user sessions

**RPC Protocol Operations:**
- **VPARPC_FUNC_GET_AUTH**: Initial authentication and token acquisition
- **VPARPC_FUNC_VERSION**: Server version information retrieval
- **VPARPC_FUNC_LOOKUP**: User credential verification and session initiation
- **VPARPC_FUNC_CREDS**: Comprehensive user information and metadata retrieval

**Network Architecture:**
- **Standalone TCP Server**: Independent server process for dedicated RPC services
- **inetd/xinetd Integration**: System service integration for scalable deployment
- **Client-Server Communication**: Bi-directional structured data exchange
- **Multiple Service Endpoints**: Support for different service names and configurations

#### 2. Multiware Framework (mwfw2)
The mwfw2 component provides comprehensive system utilities and interface capabilities:

**Window Management System:**
- **Professional Console Interface**: Unicode box-drawing characters for sophisticated text-based UIs
- **Dynamic Window Rendering**: Flexible window sizing and content management
- **Title and Border Management**: Configurable window titles with professional styling
- **Content Row Management**: Dynamic addition and formatting of display content

**System Integration:**
- **Environment Detection**: Automatic CGI vs. console mode detection
- **Shared Memory Management**: Thread-safe shared memory operations with mutex protection
- **Configuration Management**: INI-style configuration with environment variable integration
- **Logging Infrastructure**: Multi-level logging with system log integration

**Utility Components:**
- **CSV Reading**: Structured data parsing and processing
- **Hex Dump Utilities**: Binary data visualization and analysis
- **Password Management**: Secure credential handling and validation
- **Schema Compilation**: Database schema processing and validation

### Advanced Features

**Database Integration:**
- **Schema Management**: Automated database schema compilation and validation

- **RESTful API Support**: HTTP-based API endpoints for web service integration
- **Session Management**: Web-based session tracking and user management

**Development & Debugging:**
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Multi-level logging with configurable output destinations
- **Diagnostic Utilities**: Built-in debugging and system analysis tools
- **Test Framework**: Integrated testing utilities for component validation
- **Performance Monitoring**: System resource monitoring and performance analysis

### Security Features

**Authentication Architecture:**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: PSK + credential-based authentication
- **Session Security**: Time-based session tokens with automatic expiration
- **Authorization Levels**: Granular permission control based on user roles
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of authentication and authorization events

**Data Protection:**
- **Secure Communication**: Encrypted data transmission between client and server
- **Credential Management**: Secure storage and handling of user credentials
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs and RPC parameters
- **Error Handling**: Secure error handling that prevents information leakage

### Deployment Options

**Standalone Deployment:**
