 *
 * Usage Context:
 * - Designed to be utilized in server-side CGI applications.
 * - Facilitates interaction with HTTP request environments.
 *
 * Key Methods Provided by the `cgibind` Instance:
 * - `get_form_variable`: Retrieve the value of a specific input field from the CGI form data.
 * - `get_referrer`: Obtain the HTTP referrer URL.
 * - `get_referrer_path`: Extract the directory path from the HTTP referrer.
 * - `get_referrer_file`: Extract the file name from the HTTP referrer.
 *
 * Note:
 * Proper initialization of this variable is critical to ensure correct
 * behavior when processing CGI inputs. It is typically used in combination
 * with other global components like environment handlers or shared resources.
