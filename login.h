//  * within several modules like menu.cpp, journal.cpp, notesave.cpp, and render.cpp.
//  * The variable is initialized dynamically during the runtime of the respective programs.
//  *
//  * The primary purpose of `gpCgi` is to enable the retrieval and manipulation
//  * of CGI form data submitted via HTTP. It supports functions such as retrieving
//  * form variables (e.g., username, password, or other inputs), enabling modules
//  * to process and respond to those inputs appropriately.
//  *
//  * Note:
//  * - Ensure `gpCgi` is properly initialized using `new Cgicc()` before usage.
//  * - Properly manage its lifetime and delete the instance when no longer required
