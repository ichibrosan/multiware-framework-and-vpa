what do you think is the most important improvement that I should focus on first?

## AI Assistant
Based on my analysis of your framework, I believe **Security and
Authentication** should be your top priority, specifically focusing on
**secure password handling and authentication mechanisms**.

Here's why this is the most critical improvement:

## 1. **Immediate Security Risk**
Looking at your `password.cpp` file, I can see that passwords are being stored
and compared in plain text:

```c++
if (0 == strcmp(ssPassword.c_str(),
                gpCsv->getData(iRow, COL_PASSWD_PASSWORD).c_str()))
```


This is a significant security vulnerability. Plain text passwords expose your
entire user base if the data is ever compromised.

## 2. **Foundation for Everything Else**
Security is foundational - you can't build reliable features on top of an
insecure base. Once you have secure authentication:
- Users can trust your system
- You can implement proper authorization
- Other improvements become meaningful

## 3. **Relatively Straightforward to Implement**
Unlike some architectural changes that require extensive refactoring, improving
password security can be done incrementally:

### Immediate Actions (High Impact, Low Effort):
1. **Hash existing passwords** - Convert your current plain text passwords to
hashed versions
2. **Update authentication logic** - Modify the comparison to use hash
verification
3. **Add password complexity requirements** - Enforce strong passwords

### Implementation Plan:

**Phase 1: Password Hashing (Week 1-2)**
- Implement bcrypt or similar hashing library
- Create migration script to hash existing passwords
- Update `lookup_username_password()` to use hash verification

**Phase 2: Session Security (Week 3-4)**
- Implement secure session tokens (your UUID approach is good, but needs
security improvements)
- Add session expiration and cleanup
- Implement secure cookie handling

**Phase 3: Input Validation (Week 5-6)**
- Add input sanitization for all user inputs
- Implement CSRF protection for web forms
- Add rate limiting for login attempts

## 4. **Compliance and Trust**
Proper password security is often required for:
- Industry compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- Professional credibility
- User trust and adoption

## 5. **Minimal Disruption**
This improvement can be implemented without changing your overall architecture,
making it less risky than major refactoring projects.

## Quick Win Example:
You could start by adding a simple password hashing function to your existing
`password` class:

```c++
#include <openssl/sha.h>  // or use bcrypt library

std::string password::hash_password(const std::string& password) {
    // Implementation with proper salt and hashing
    // Return hashed password
}

bool password::verify_password(const std::string& password, const std::string&
hash) {
    // Verify password against hash
    // Return true if valid
}
```


**Bottom Line**: Security vulnerabilities can destroy user trust and expose
you to legal liability. Fixing password security first gives you the biggest
risk reduction with relatively modest effort, creating a solid foundation for
all other improvements.

password hashing in your framework?
