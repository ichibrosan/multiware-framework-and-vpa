This current implementation is the latest in a long series of
attempts to determining the mix of features for my software framework.

In each previous case The framework has grown to a certain size and
I have found it difficult to debug because of its monolithic nature.

I have decided the Test Driven Development is the only way I am
going to achieve the complexity level I want with any assurance
that the software is performing as desired.
