DESCRIPTION
       The  getenv()  function searches the environment list to find the envi‐
       ronment variable name, and returns a pointer to the corresponding value
       string.
       The  GNU-specific secure getenv() function is just like getenv() except
                               -
       that it returns NULL in cases where  "secure  execution"  is  required.
       Secure  execution  is  required  if one of the following conditions was
       true when the program run by the calling process was loaded:
       •  the process's effective user ID did not match its real  user  ID  or
          the  process's  effective  group  ID did not match its real group ID
          (typically this is the result of executing  a  set-user-ID  or  set-
          group-ID program);
       •  the effective capability bit was set on the executable file; or
       •  the process has a nonempty permitted capability set.
       Secure  execution may also be required if triggered by some Linux secu‐
       rity modules.
       The secure getenv() function is intended for use in general-purpose li‐
                 -
       braries  to  avoid  vulnerabilities  that could occur if set-user-ID or
       set-group-ID programs accidentally trusted the environment.
RETURN VALUE
       The getenv() function returns a pointer to the value  in  the  environ‐
       ment, or NULL if there is no match.
VERSIONS
       secure getenv() first appeared in glibc 2.17.

NOTES
       The strings in the environment list are of the form name=value.
       As typically implemented, getenv() returns a pointer to a string within
       the  environment  list.   The  caller must take care not to modify this
       string, since that would change the environment of the process.
       The implementation of getenv() is not required to  be  reentrant.   The
       string pointed to by the return value of getenv() may be statically al‐
       located, and  can  be  modified  by  a  subsequent  call  to  getenv(),
       putenv(3), setenv(3), or unsetenv(3).
       The  "secure  execution"  mode  of secure getenv() is controlled by the
                                                -
       AT SECURE flag contained in the auxiliary vector passed from the kernel
         -
       to user space.
