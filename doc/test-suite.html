As the framework is comprised of a number of service layers,
any confidence testing must be done from the bottom, up. Each
service layer must be prior to executing any higher level code.

The tests shall be numbered starting with one, that being the
level of functionality in the framework. Since the testing will
be performed from the bottom up, the list is inverted.

<ul>8. verify that log.writev works</ul>

<ul>7. verify that log.write works</ul>

<ul>6. verify that the proper log folder exists</ul>

<ul>5. verify that osIface.genLogFQFS is working correctly</ul>

<ul>4. verify that the cgicc system is installed and can be
  accessed and environment variables can be accessed.
  New version 2025-01-09 20:37 uses pOS->genCgiCBD(). </ul>

<ul>3.2 verify environment functionality</ul>

<ul>3.1 verify shared functionality</ul>

<ul>3. verify  that Apache HTTP Server is operating and can
  execute binary CGI scripts from $(USERDIR)/cgi-bin</ul>

<ul>2.1 verify version of shared region</ul>

<ul>2. verify that Apache HTTP Server is operating and can
retrieve static html pages from $(USERDIR) using https:// protocol.</ul>

<ul>1. verify that Apache HTTP Server is operating and can
retrieve static html pages from $(USERDIR) using http:// protocol</ul>

<p><h3>Notes about test5:</h3>
<p>Verifying that osIfac e::genLogFQFS is working properly is somewhat
complex. The first assumption is that it is called with the __FILE__
and __FUNCTION__ predefined macros as parameters. To the best of my
knowledge, __FILE__ will ALWAYS resolve into a fully qualified file
specification starting with the initial slash of the root file system.
The second assumption is that the last term of the macro resolves into
a normally named source filename like module.cpp.</p>
