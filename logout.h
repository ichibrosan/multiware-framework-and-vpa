 * to process CGI (Common Gateway Interface) requests, enabling the application to
 * handle web-based form data and interact with web servers.
 *
 * Responsibilities of gpCgi include:
 * - Reading CGI input data such as form variables and environment variables.
 * - Facilitating parsing of form arguments submitted via HTTP GET or POST requests.
 *
 * It is generally created alongside other system and environment objects that are essential
 * for the application's initialization and processing phases.
 *
 * Note: Proper memory management is crucial, particularly ensuring that this pointer is
 * deleted when no longer needed to avoid memory leaks.
