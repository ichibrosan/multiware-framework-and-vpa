 * The lock is acquired upon calling this method and will remain active
 * until the lifetime of the `std::lock_guard` object ends.
 *
 * Thread-safety: This function ensures that access to the shared memory
 * resource is safely coordinated between multiple threads or processes.
 *
 * Usage Considerations:
 * - This method must only be invoked after initializing the shared memory
 *   and associated mutex.
 * - Improper use, such as failing to unlock or forcefully interrupting a
 *   thread holding the lock, may lead to deadlocks or inability to access
 *   the resource across threads or processes.

/**
 * Accesses the shared memory resource in a thread-safe manner.
 *
 * This method ensures safe and synchronized access to the shared memory
 * segment by employing RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization)
 * principles for locking the associated mutex. A `std::lock_guard` is used
 * to automatically acquire the lock at the beginning of the method and
 * release it when the scope ends. This prevents race conditions and
 * guarantees safe interactions with the shared memory resource during
 * concurrent operations.
 *
 * Notes:
 * - This method assumes that the mutex and shared memory resource
 * (`m_pShMemng`) have been properly initialized before invocation.
 * - The shared memory operations performed during the locked state must not
 *   result in undefined or unsafe behavior.
 *
 * Thread Safety:
 * - Thread-safe by design through the use of `SharedMemoryMutex`.

/**

 * completed to allow other threads or processes to access the resource.
 *
 * Note:
 * - Proper usage involves locking the shared memory using the corresponding
 *   `lockSharedMemory()` method before calling this method.
 * - Failure to call this method after completing shared memory operations
 *   could lead to deadlock or resource contention in a multi-threaded
 *   environment.
