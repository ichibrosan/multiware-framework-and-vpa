 * @class password

 * user lookup operations using provided usernames and passwords.

	 * Dumps the metadata header from the schema's associated CSV data structure in a tabular HTML format.

	 * from the schema's `readCsv` object. It iterates through the first six columns of the
	 * `ROW_META_HDR` row in the CSV data to create the table header.
	 *
	 * The output is sent to the standard console output stream.
	 *
	 * Preconditions:
	 * - The `m_pSchema` member must be initialized and not null.
	 * - `m_pSchema->m_pReadCsv` must point to a valid and initialized `readCsv` object containing CSV data.
	 *
	 * Usage Considerations:
	 * - This method outputs HTML markup directly to the console, which may be used in a larger context
	 *   where HTML rendering is expected.
	 * - Ensure the proper handling of external dependencies (`m_pSchema`, `m_pSchema->m_pReadCsv`) before invoking this method.
